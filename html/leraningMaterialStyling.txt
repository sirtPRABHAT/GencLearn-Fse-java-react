    9 	<h1>Why to Learn java Programming?</h1>
   10 	<div>
   11 		<p title="Java Programming">Java is a MUST for students and working professionals
   12 			to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working
   13 			in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key
   14 			advantages of learning Java Programming:</p>
   15 
   16 		<dl>
   17 			<dt class="reasons">Object Oriented</dt>
   18 			<dd id="description01">In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily
   19 				extended since it is based on the Object model.</dd>
   20 			<dt class="reasons">Platform Independent</dt>
   21 			<dd id="description02">Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++,
   22 				when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific
   23 				machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code
   24 				is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine
   25 				(JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</dd>
   26 
   27 			<dt class="reasons">Simple</dt>
   28 			<dd id="description03">Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the
   29 				basic concept of <em>OOP Java</em>, it would be easy to master.</dd>
   30 			<dt class="reasons">Secure</dt>
   31 			<dd id="description04">With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free,
   32 				tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on
   33 				public-key encryption.</dd>
   34 			<dt class="reasons" >Architecture-neutral</dt>
   35 			<dd id="description05">Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file
   36 				format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors,
   37 				with the presence of Java runtime system.</dd>
   38 			<dt class="reasons" >Portable</dt>
   39 			<dd id="description06">Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation
   40 				dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. <em>Compiler
   41 				in Java is written in ANSI C</em> with a clean portability boundary,
   42 				which is a POSIX subset.</dd>
   43 			<dt class="reasons">Robust</dt>
   44 			<dd id="description07">Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by
   45 				emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime
   46 				checking.</dd>
